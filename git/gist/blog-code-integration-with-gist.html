                    <p>
                        If you have a technical web blog it is common to write a sample snippet of code while explaining
                        a
                        concept. The Most difficult part while inserting code is highlighting a key words and pretty
                        printing
                        (formatting)
                        the code in the web page. There are a lot of Javascript plug-ins to format the code. But all
                        these
                        plug-ins will do
                        what it suppose to do. But the major problem with this approach is we need to include the code
                        in
                        HTML pages. When you want to change or update the code you have to update the web page in hosted
                        web
                        server.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Github introduced a tool called Gist to keep the snippet of code. This is very simple to include
                        the
                        code in web pages with syntax highlighter and pretty print. Use below steps to include Gist code
                        snippet in your web pages.

                    <p>
                        If you're navigating to Gist for the first time follow below steps. Otherwise, skip to next

                        </li>
                        <li>Click on <b>+</b> sign at right corner of the site and select <b>New gist</b>. This option
                            will
                            take you to new <a target="_blank" href="https://gist.github.com/">gist</a> page

                        Alternatively, you can open the <a target="_blank" href="https://gist.github.com/">gist</a> page
                        directly and can sign in.

                    <p>
                        Use below steps to create source file and include in the web page.
                    <ol>
                        <li>Click on <b>New gist</b> option</li>
                        <li>Enter file name with extension. Extension is very important. <a target="_blank"
                                                                                            href="https://gist.github.com/">Gist</a>
                            tool will highlight the syntax and format the code based on extension
                        </li>
                        <li>Add your code in code text box</li>
                        <li>Once you are done with the code click on <b>Create secret gist</b> or <b>Create public
                            gist</b> button based on your preference
                        </li>
                        <li>You can add as many files you want by clicking on <b>Add file</b> button</li>
                        <li>Once you click on create gist button, it will create the gist. Copy the embed link.

                        </li>
                        <li>Include the copied embed link in your HTML page wherever you want to display the code. For
                            example,
                            <div class="syntax">

                    <h3>Add single file</h3>
                    <p>
                        It is pretty common to have more than one file for an article. Creating gist for every single
                        file
                        and maintaining these files are very difficult. we can add multiple file in single gist. By
                        default
                        if you add the gist embed URL, you will see all the files. If you want to add a specific file in
                        web
                        page from gist you can pass the file name as parameter.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For example, if you have two files <i>File1.js</i> and <i>File2.js</i> in single gist. Use
                        script
                        tag with <i>File1.js</i> as file parameter
                    <div class="syntax">
                        &lt;script src="gist embed url?file=File1.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
                    </div>
                    </p>
