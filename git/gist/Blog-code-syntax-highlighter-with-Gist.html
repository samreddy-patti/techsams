                <p>
                    If you have a technical web blog it is common to write a sample snippet of code while explaining a
                    concept. Most difficult part while inserting code is highlighting a key words and pretty printing
                    (formatting)
                    the code in web page. There are a lot of Javascript plug-ins to format the code. But all these
                    plug-ins will do
                    what it suppose to do. But the major problem with this approach is we need to include the code in
                    HTML pages. When you want to change or update the code you have to update the web page in hosted web
                    server.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Github introduced a tool called Gist to keep the snippet of code. This is very simple to include the
                    code in web pages with syntax highlighter and pretty print. Use below steps to include Gist code
                    snippet in your web pages.
                </p>
                <h3 id="enableGist">Navigate to Gist</h3>
                <p>
                    If you're navigating to Gist for the first time follow below steps. Otherwise skip to next section.
                <ol>
                    <li>Open <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">Github</a> and login with your account</li>
                    <li>Click on <b>+</b> sign at right corner of the site and select <b>New gist</b>. This option will
                        take you to new <a target="_blank" href="https://gist.github.com/">gist</a> page
                        <img src="gist-navigation.png" class="half-size">
                    </li>
                </ol>

                </p>
                <p>
                    Alternatively, you can open the <a target="_blank" href="https://gist.github.com/">gist</a> page
                    directly and can sign in.
                </p>
                <h3 id="insertSnippet">Add snippet</h3>
                <p>
                    Use below steps create source file and include in web page.
                <ol>
                    <li>Click on <b>New gist</b> option</li>
                    <li>Enter file name with extension. Extension is very important. <a target="_blank"
                                                                                        href="https://gist.github.com/">Gist</a>
                        tool will highlight the syntax and format the code based on extension
                    </li>
                    <li>Add your code in code text box</li>
                    <li>Once you are done with the code you can click on <b>Create secret gist</b> or <b>Create public
                        gist</b> button based on your preference
                    </li>
                    <li>You can add as many files you want by clicking one <b>Add file button</b></li>
                    <li>Once you click on create gist button, it will create the gist. Copy the embed link.
                        <img src="add-gist-snippet.png">
                    </li>
                    <li>Include the copied embed link in your HTML page wherever you want to display the code. For
                        example,
                        <div class="syntax">
                            &lt;script src="<a
                                href="https://gist.github.com/samreddy-patti/31659e4a51c4e069818e670df79598cc"
                                target="_blank">https://gist.github.com/samreddy-patti/31659e4a51c4e069818e670df79598cc.js</a>"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
                        </div>
                    </li>

                </ol>
                </p>
                <h3>Add single file</h3>
                <p>
                    It is pretty common to have more than one file for an article. Creating gist for every single file
                    and maintaining these files are very difficult. we can add multiple file in single gist. By default
                    if you add the gist embed URL, you will see all the files. If you want to add a specific file in web
                    page from gist you can pass the file name as parameter.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example, if you have two files <i>File1.js</i> and <i>File2.js</i> in single gist. If you
                    want to add only <i>File1.js</i>,
                <div class="syntax">
                    &lt;script src="gist embed url?file=File1.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
                </div>
                <b>file</b> query parameter allow you to pass the file name.
                </p>
