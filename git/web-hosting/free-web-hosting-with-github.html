                    <h3 id="introduction" class="text-primary">Introduction</h3>
                    <p>This article intended to explain how to use <a target="_blank"
                                                                      href="https://pages.github.com/">Github page</a>
                        as a
                        static
                        web hosting server. Usually, if you want to have a website, you need to buy a domain and then
                        buy
                        storage space to keep the static files. There are lots of internet domain providers in the
                        market. I
                        did my domain registration through <a target="_blank" href="http://www.godaddy.com">Godaddy</a>.
                        You can choose the domain providers as you like.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Once you register the domain you need web pages to reach your contents. These contents could be
                        a
                        plain text, images, music files, videos and etc. Like domain name providers, there are lot of
                        hosting providers in the market. The majority of the domain providers will provide
                        hosting as well, but you need to pay money for that.</p>
                    <p>
                        If you are planning to have a standard or static contents of your web pages and don’t need any
                        special software (called static web hosting) there are lot providers who gives web hosting for
                        cheaper price. For example, <a target="_blank"
                                                       href="https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/projects/host-static-website/">Amazon
                        S3</a>static web hosting. Now, we don't need to spend money for this. Yes, we can have a web
                        hosting
                        in Github without paying a single penny. This is very useful for the people who want to have a
                        web
                        site with static web pages like having company profile, business brochure, blog or personal
                        profile.
                        Use below steps to create a page in Github and map to your domain.</p>

                    <h3 id="createPage" class="text-primary">Create Github page</h3>
                    <p>The first step to host the web page in github is creating a page. Follow steps mentioned in
                        github <a
                                target="_blank" href="https://pages.github.com/">page</a> to create a page. Don’t forget
                        to
                        create your repo with <i>.github.io</i> suffix. For example, if you want to create a repository
                        something, like<i>techsams</i> then use name as <i>techsams.github.io</i>. if you don’t give
                        this
                        suffix, it will still work, but the default page will be rendered from <i>README.md</i> file. If
                        you
                        give a suffix, it will pick <i>index.html</i> as a default page.</p>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h3 id="configuration" class="text-primary">Github configuration</h3>
                    <p>There is a good documentation available in github with the instructions to use a custom URL with
                        <a
                                target="_blank"
                                href="https://help.github.com/articles/using-a-custom-domain-with-github-pages/">Github
                            pages</a>, but you need to go through multiple links to achieve this. Use below steps to add
                        your
                        domain into github.
                    <ol>
                        <li>Login into <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/">Github</a>. Select your page
                            repository from <i>Your repositories</i> list and click on <i>Settings</i>
                            <img alt="git repo setting" src="git-repo-settings.png">
                        </li>
                        <li>Scroll down until you see <i>Github pages</i>. If you already not yet enabled the page,
                            select
                            the branch to keep your web pages and click on the <i>Save</i> button.
                        </li>
                        <li>Once you have enabled the page option, give the domain name and click on the <i>Save</i>
                            button. You will see a success message with your website name. The moment you save domain,
                            <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/">Github</a>will add a file called a
                            <i>CNAME</i> in your repository.
                            <img alt="github pages" src="github-pages.png">

                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    </p>

                    <p>Once you are done with <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/">Github</a> configuration go
                        to
                        DNS
                        configuration.
                    </p>

                <section>
                    <h3 id="dnsConfiguration" class="text-primary">DNS configuration</h3>
                    <p>
                        To configure your domain with Github, you should know how to add DNS records with the DNS
                        provider.
                        If
                        you don’t know how to do it, contact your domain provider. Most of the domain providers will
                        have a
                        web
                        page to manage your DNS records online. Here, I am using <a target="_blank"
                                                                                    href="http://www.godaddy.com">godaddy</a>
                        DNS page to give the explanation. There are two different types of domains i.e., sub domain and
                        apex
                        domain. Sub domain usually comes with <i>www</i>. For example <a target="_blank"
                                                                                         href="http://www.techjira.com">www.techjira.com</a>
                        is a sub domain. Apex domain doesn’t have <i>www</i>. For example<a target="_blank"
                                                                                            href="http://techjira.com">http://techjira.com</a>
                        is an apex domain. DNS configuration is different for sub domains and apex.
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>First login into DNS provider website and go to DNS setting</li>
                        <li>Remove all the entries if you have any. Make sure you don’t have <i>A</i> records or
                            <i>CNAME</i>
                            records
                        </li>
                        <li>If you are using sub domain(WWW) add an entry of <i>CNAME</i> with value as <i>YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME.github.io</i>.
                            for example, if
                            you have a github user as "sivreddyp" and then the entry should be sivreddyp.gitgub.io
                        </li>
                        <li>If you have apex domain, then add an entry of <i>A</i> with the IP address of
                            <i>192.30.252.153</i>
                            or <i>192.30.252.154</i>
                        </li>
                        <li>If you have both sub domain and apex, then you need both entries. Sample records look like
                            below
                            with godady provider
                            <img alt="DNS setting with godaday" src="godady-dns-setting.png">
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>That's all. You are done with your hosting. Once your configuration is done, access your website
                        from
                        a
                        browser. Please note that some DNS providers will take up to 1 day to refresh your records. If
                        you
                        want
                        to verify the configuration is done correctly or not not use below steps to verify.</p>

                    <p>
                        You can verify the configuration in multiple ways. One easiest way is checking online. Go to
                        online
                        <a target="_blank" href="https://toolbox.googleapps.com/apps/dig/">dig</a> tool and click on
                        <i>A</i> OR
                        <i>CNAME</i> to verify your records. It should be something like below.
