                    <p>
                        World Wide Web (WWW) is a very hot channel for any business. The present trend is getting
                        business
                        on web presence. Getting a business on web presence is very simple - create an awesome customer
                        face
                        web application and deploy it on server. Let's assume, initially you deployed your website on
                        below
                        architecture.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <img alt="web architecture" src="common_system.png" width="50%">
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        An HTTP server is a web server which will take the HTTP request and pass it to App server. App
                        Server is an application server which contains your application.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Let's start the discussion with some example. Assume the app server can take maximum 500 TPS
                        (Transactions Per Second). That means your application can process 500 requests in a second.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Note</b> - TPS depends on various parameters like server physical configuration (Memory,
                        Processor, Network and etc.) and application architecture.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Lets assume, your business is growing in internet and number of users are increasing. That
                        means the load on your server is increasing. At some point of time 500 TPS is not sufficient to
                        serve all user requests. you need to look back on server configuration and need to scale your
                        server
                        configuration (vertical scaling). Even if you increase the server configuration, if the load on
                        the
                        server is keep on increasing again at some point of time your single server is not sufficient to
                        serve all the request. In this case we need to add another server.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Irrespective of assumption there are various reasons to have more than one server with
                        application
                        deployed in each. Below are the main reasons.
                    <ol>
                        <li>As we discussed above, we need to add more servers to handle more requests</li>
                        <li>Due to hardware or network failure the single server is not reachable. In this case you need
                            a
                            backup server (also called failover server).
                        </li>
                        <li>Due to natural disaster the infrastructure is collapsed and your server is no more exist.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Overall, we should have more than one server to do business online. As we discussed, the HTTP
                        server
                        is the one who interacts with application server based on the request. Now we need to answer on
                        below questions.

                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            How the HTTP server knows how many app servers are there with application deployed or how to
                            configure multiple application servers in HTTP server?
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            On what base HTTP server will route the request to application servers?
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            How to configure failover servers?
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Well, we will get the answers to all above questions by the end of this article.

                    <h3 id="loadinBalancer">What is Load balancing?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Load balancing is a technique used to distribute the application requests across the servers.
                        Load
                        balancer uses different kind of algorithms to route the request.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Till now we are taking about load balancing on web application. Load balancing is not limited to
                        web
                        application. We can use this concept in multiple places. For example,
                    <ul>
                        <li>DNS load balancing</li>
                        <li>HTTP load balancing</li>
                        <li>SSL load balancing</li>
                        <li>Network load balancing</li>
                        <li>Database load balancing</li>
                        <li>Cloud load balancing</li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This article is aimed to discuss on web application load balancing. See below diagram to
                        understand
                        the load balancing.
                    </p>

                        In above diagram I replaced the web server name with load balancer. Cluster mean a group of
                        servers.
                        <b>App Server1</b> and <b>App Server2</b> are the application servers which they are in one
                        group or
                        cluster to serve for the same purpose.

                    <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Route the request</b> - Load balancer works as a reverse proxy to distribute the
                            application
                            traffic across the servers based on the chosen algorithm
                        </li>
                        <li><b> Health check</b> - Gets the health statistics of each server. This check is done based
                            on
                            the time frame. If the server is down due various reasons, the load balancer will not send
                            the
                            request to that server. Once the server is up again requests will be routed.
                        </li>
                        <li><b>Session stickiness </b>- Maintains the session stickiness. The load balancer will keep
                            track
                            of the previous requests. For example, if user U1 is severed through server A, all the U1
                            user
                            requests will be served from server A. Session stickiness is optional. You can enable or
                            disable
                            this based on need. The load balancer will maintains the session stickiness using the client
                            IP
                            address, cookies or URL. Session stickiness may disturb the load balancing algorithm.
                        </li>
                        <li><b>Failover servers </b>- We can maintain the list reserved servers or backup servers. The
                            load
                            balancer will maintains the list of backup servers and route the requests to backup servers
                            if
                            none of the primary servers are available to serve the request.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Load balancer can be a physical device or a software. Based on need you need to choose the one.
                        You
                        can google to know about load balancer devices. <a href="https://f5.com/" target="_blank">F5</a>
                        BIG-IP load balancer is widely used. <a href="https://f5.com/" target="_blank">F5</a> supports
                        load balance over multiple data centers.</p>
                    <p>
                        Software based load balancers will work along with HTTP servers. Based on popularity below are

                        So, we have device based as well as software based load balancers. Now the confusion is which
                        one to
                        choose. It's completely based on the business requirement. There is an article published by <a
                            href="http://nginx.com/blog/five-reasons-use-software-load-balancer/"
                            target="_blank">Nginx</a>
                        which explains why to choose software based load balancer.

                        Once you decide to go with load balancer making right choice to choose the one which are
                        available
                        in the market is the most challenging question. Here I am trying to give some guidance to
