                    <p>
                        In the market, there are tons of frameworks and libraries for front end application development
                        and
                        this count going up day by day. Though there are many, the most used or trendy ones are <a
                            href="https://reactjs.org" target="_blank">React</a> and <a
                            href="https://angular.io" target="_blank">Angular</a>. Both of these technology goals are
                        the same but using different approaches. Choosing one of these frameworks is always challenging.
                        There are a lot of articles on this topic explaining about up and downsides of each. I am
                        attempting my view to compare both of these in practice. My intention is simple, before
                        choosing anything better we should get hands-on and then decide which suits us. Let's start...

                        <h5>React</h5>
                        <p><a href="https://reactjs.org/" target="_blank">React</a> is a JavaScript library developed
                            and maintained by Facebook. It uses plain JavaScript with HTML elements along with custom
                            elements inside the Javascript called JSX. Hence it uses plain JavaScript, if you
                            already know Javascript and HTML it is easy to understand and learn. People who are coming
                            from .Net, Java or other backend technologies are a bit more challenging to understand the
                            concepts. React also uses a concept called state management and we need to understand it
                            properly. React is UI only library - that means you need to learn some other frameworks or
                            libraries to make a proper single page application. For example,
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <b>Routing</b> - There are lot of routing libraries in market to support routing for
                                React.
                                Refer <a href="https://reactjs.org/community/routing.html" target="_blank">routing</a>
                                link
                                for list.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <b>State container</b> - There are different ways to maintain a state in React. <a

                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <b>AJAX library</b> - We have freedom to choose any library to make AJAX calls. Most
                                familiar
                                once are - like <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API"
                                                   target="_blank">Fetch API</a>, <a href="http://reactivex.io/"
                                                                                     target="_blank">Rx.js</a>, <a
                                    href="https://github.com/axios/axios" target="_blank">Axios</a>, <a
                                    href="http://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajax/" target="_blank">JQuery</a> and <a
                                    href="https://reactjs.org/community/data-fetching.html" target="_blank">others</a>.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            You have freedom to choose any of these libraries based on need. Which means, when you move
                            to
                            another project and using different combination then you have to learn that as well.

                        <h5>Angular</h5>
                        <p>
                            <a href="https://angular.io/" target="_blank">Angular</a> is a framework developed and
                            maintained by Google. It uses a set of a stack
                            which will be common across the applications. Angular uses <a target="_blank" href="">Typescript</a>
                            statically type programming style, in-built routing API and <a href="http://reactivex.io/"
                                                                                           target="_blank">Rx.js</a> as
                            AJAX API. Due to statically typed programing style, it is easy to understand the code for
                            the people who
                            are coming from backend technologies like .NET and Java.

                            Angular uses a standard set of a stack. It means - learn Angular and use the same stack in
                            all
                            projects. This will minimise the effort of learning. It doesn't mean that Angular doesn't
                            allow to choose other stacks if you like. For example, we can use <a
                                href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API" target="_blank">Fetch
                            API</a> instead of <a href="http://reactivex.io/" target="_blank">Rx.js</a> or even we can
                            use React as view in Angular.

                        <p>
                            From my knowledge and experience, most of the IDE's or editors used to program React and
                            Angular
                            are,
                        <ol>

                        <p>
                            My preference is to use <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/"

                            but it is not free. If you are looking for a free version then <a

                    <p>
                        The major challenge with front end components is portability. When we develop the component
                        using
                        one stack, we can use that component only in the same stack. For example, if
                        you develop a button component using React we can use it only in React based application. Hence
                        components tied to technology stack we can't reuse the component in other stacks.
                    </p>

                        a feature to run Angular components to run in React or other stacks. Angular elements are
                        Angular
                        components packaged as custom elements, a web standard for defining new HTML elements in a

                    <p>
                        <b>React</b> is a library which fit in view of MVC model. As explained in the <a
                            href="#learning">learning</a> sectionIt it doesn't follow any architecture and we need to
                        choose and design how the application architecture would be. But, React follow the component
                        model and make sure you develop the UI components and integrate each other in a page. We will
                        see how to do this in below sections.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Angular</b> is a framework follows MVC pattern for the application. In reality, most of the
                        front
                        end frameworks follow MV*. where 'C' (controller) is not used. Google described Angular as
                        MVW(Model-View-Whatever), we can replace called View-Model(VM) in Whatever to describe Angular
                        architecture. Refer <a href="https://angular.io/guide/architecture" target="_blank">Angular
                        architecture</a> page to understand better. Angular uses decorator for dependency injection.
                        Angular also follow a component model for UI elements. Each component in Angular is combined
                        with
                        templates, directives, pipes and services. Below diagram explains how these are tied together.

                                    React uses <i>ReactDOM</i> API to render the templates. Templates are part of
                                    Javascript
                                    file which is called JSX(Javascript XML).
                                    <script src="https://gist.github.com/samreddy-patti/1a5e28c587f1fc2fa3218d4720617f94.js?file=index.js"></script>
                                    <i>ReactDOM</i> API uses a concept called <a
                                        href="https://reactjs.org/docs/faq-internals.html" target="_blank">virtual
                                    dom</a>
                                    instead of using browser API to render the components. Virtual DOM will help to
                                    render
                                    or re-render components only when they are changed.
                                </p>
                            </div>

                                    Angular clearly separates the concerns. It supports two different ways for
                                    templating. One approach is with in component
                                    file through decorator. Another approach is create separate html file and import
                                    into
                                    component.
                                </p>
                                <p>Template part of component looks like below,
                                    <script src="https://gist.github.com/samreddy-patti/1a5e28c587f1fc2fa3218d4720617f94.js?file=app.component.ts"></script>

                                <p>Create separate template and including in component looks like below,

                    <div>
                        <h5>Data binding</h5>

                        <div class="row ml-2 mr-2">
                            <div class="col-md-6 border p-0">
                                <div class="tech-section-header">React</div>
                                <p>
                                    React uses uni-directional flow to bind the data with UI components. Data can be
                                    updated
                                    only with <i>this.setState()</i> method. See below demo to understand the data
                                    binding.
                                    Click on <b>Preview</b> button to see the UI or <a
                                        href="https://stackblitz.com/edit/react-databinding" target="_blank">here</a> to
                                    see
                                    in new window
                                    <iframe src="https://stackblitz.com/edit/react-databinding?embed=1&file=index.js&hideNavigation=1"
                                            frameborder="0" width="100%" height="480px"></iframe>
                                    Sometimes two way data binding also makes UI simple. For example when we are
                                    developing
                                    forms. React also support two way data binding using <a
                                        href="https://reactjs.org/docs/two-way-binding-helpers.html"
                                        target="_blank">helper</a> classes.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    You can notice two things in above example. First, HTML <i>class</i> attribute
                                    become <i>className</i>. Second,
                                    <i>onChange</i> event is working differently than HTML event. According to HTML,
                                    <i>onchange</i> should trigger when you loose the focus from input. But it is
                                    working like as <i>oninput</i> event.
                                </p>
                            </div>
                            <div class="col-md-6 border p-0">
                                <div class="tech-section-header">Angular</div>
                                <p>
                                    React also support data binding in two different directions i.e., one way and two
                                    way.
                                    Below example is similar to react example with one way data binding. Click on
                                    <b>Preview</b> button to see the UI or <a
                                        href="https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-data-one-way-binding"
                                        target="_blank">here</a> to see
                                    in new window
                                    <iframe src="https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-data-one-way-binding?embed=1&file=src/app/app.component.ts&hideNavigation=1"
                                            frameborder="0" width="100%" height="480px"></iframe>
                                    To sync the UI with React view, I used <i>oninput</i> event instead of
                                    <i>onchange</i> event for input box.
                                </p>
                                <p>If you want two way binding use <i>[(ngModel)]</i> directive instead of
                                    <i>[value]</i> in
                                    <i>input</i> tag and remove <i>(input)</i> event, </p>
                                <p>
                                <pre class="code">
    &lt;input class="form-control" placeholder="Enter your name" [(ngModel)]="name"/&gt;
                        </pre>
                                </p>

                                    <i>React</i> supports control states in two ways. One, using expressions along with
                                    elements. Second, use plain Javascript to add elements conditionally. Below example
                                    uses
                                    expression.

                                    <i>Angular</i> has separate directives to handle the template for control
                                    statements like <i>ngIf</i>, <i>ngFor</i> and <i>ngSwitch</i>. To make UI dynamic,
                                    Angular has special <i>ng-template</i> and <i>ng-container</i>elements. Check <a

                            Components can communicate in two ways. One by passing input and other
                            one is returning the value. Below demo has two components called <i>Menu</i> and <i>Body</i>.
                            When user clicks on menu item, <i>Menu</i> component will return the page name. <i>Body</i>
                            component will take the returned value and display the appropriate body. <i>Body</i>
                            component will take <i>page</i> as input and <i>onMenuSelection</i> as callback for output.
                            Click on <i>Preview</i> button to see the UI.

                                    <i>React</i> has different ways to communicate
                                    components. Most common way is through <i>props</i>. We can use <i>props</i> to pass
                                    the value for input and callback for output.

                        As mentioned before, <i>React</i> and <i>Angular</i> has its own advantage and disadvantages.
                        Most considerable points are,
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <i>React</i> uses dynamically typed programming modal with store concepts. <i>Facebook</i>
                        created React view library with virtual DOM to solve their specific (may be common for all web
                        apps) problem which is displaying bulk data which can change dynamically. JSX modifies a lot of
                        HTML elements or attributes to make it work with React. Each project has free to choose
                        different tech stack to create a framework for an application which increases the learning curve.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <i>Angular</i> uses statically typed programming modal with <i>Typescript</i>. This will help
                        better understanding and maintains for large scale projects. But has lot of boilerplate code or
                        configuration to develop components. Thanks to <i>Angular CLI</i> for minimizing a manual
                        configuration.
                        <i>Angular</i> elements can be used with any other frameworks which help more re-usability. <i>Angular</i>
                        uses all HTML elements and attributes with an extra set of elements to separate Javascript and
                        HTML. Uses a standard set of a stack which minimises the learning curve. Easy to pick for .NET and
                        Java background people.
